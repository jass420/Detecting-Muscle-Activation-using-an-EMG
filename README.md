# Detecting-Muscle-Activation-using-an-EMG
− The muscle waves, in the form of sound waves obtained from an EMG machine, were first divided into different classes
(flexed and not flexed) and turned into arrays.
− Then, a Multi-layer Perceptron model was trained on the arrays and was used to differentiate if a muscle is being flexed or
not
